          794-800: Ivar the Boneless is believed to have been born sometime
          during this period, as the son of the legendary Viking chieftain
          Ragnar Lothbrok. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Late 8th Century: Ivar's nickname, "the Boneless,"
          comes into play, although the origin and meaning of this epithet
          remain debated among historians. 
          </p>
          <p>
          865: Ivar, along with his brothers,
          leads the Viking Great Heathen Army's invasion of England. This army
          aims to conquer and plunder various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. 
          </p>
          <p>
          866-870: The
          Great Heathen Army, including Ivar, engages in a series of battles and
          campaigns across England, capturing territories, and leaving an
          indelible mark on English history. 
          </p>
<p>
          870s: Ivar's role becomes more
          prominent in the leadership of the Great Heathen Army as his brothers
          pass away or retire from active campaigns. 
          </p>
          <p>
          870s-early 880s: Ivar's
          exploits during this period include various battles and strategic
          maneuvers across England. He is known for his cunning tactics and
          ability to adapt to changing circumstances. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Late 9th Century: Ivar's
          death is believed to have occurred sometime around the late 9th
          century. However, the exact date and circumstances of his death remain
          uncertain and are often part of the legends and myths surrounding him.

          <p>
          It's important to note that the information about Ivar the Boneless is
          drawn from a mixture of historical records, sagas, and oral
          traditions, which can sometimes blur the line between fact and
          fiction. As a result, some aspects of his life and deeds might be
          exaggerated or veiled in mystery. Nonetheless, Ivar's legacy as a
          skilled warrior, strategist, and enigmatic figure continues to
          captivate the imagination, making him an enduring symbol of the Viking
          Age.
