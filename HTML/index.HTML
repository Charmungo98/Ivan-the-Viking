        The Vikings first began their invasion of Britain in AD 793, a historic
        year between two "nations" that sparked the beginning of a 200 year
        bwar between the Vikings and the Anglo Saxons. The centuries long war
        saw the loss of countless lives of men, women and children, some innocent and
        some... less so.
        
        The vast majority of the Vikings inital invasions were
        fueled purely by greed and their desire to plunder, however, as the
        decades progressed the invasions were spurred by an alterior motive,
        especially the invasions exercised by Ivan the Boneless. This article
        will dive into the history of the Vikings, particulary the most famous
        and arguably successful Viking of all, Ivan the Boneless, son of Ragnar
        Lothbrok.

        The Vikings initial attack saw the seige of a monestary at Lindisfarne.
        Lindisfarne is a small island off the Northeast coast of England. The
        Vikings took no mercy upon the poor Monks that inhabited this tiny
        island, many were drowned, slaughtered like cattle or used as slaves.

        Following the seige of Lindisfarne, many nearby villages in and isles 
        were pillaged and plundered by the savage beasts from Scandenavia and 
        within a few years after the first attack in AD 789, none of the British 
        Isles were safe.
