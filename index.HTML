        <p>
          The Vikings first began their invasion of Britain in AD 793, a
          historic year between two "nations" that sparked the beginning of a
          200 year war between the Vikings and the Anglo Saxons. The centuries
          long war saw the loss of countless lives of men, women and children,
          some innocent and some... less so. The vast majority of the Vikings
          inital invasions were fueled purely by greed and their desire to
          plunder, however, as the decades progressed the invasions were spurred
          by an alterior motive, especially the invasions exercised by Ivar the
          Boneless. This article will dive into the history of the Vikings,
          particulary the most famous and arguably successful Viking of all,
          Ivar the Boneless, son of Ragnar Lothbrok.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Vikings initial attack saw the seige of a monestary at
          Lindisfarne. Lindisfarne is a small island off the Northeast coast of
          England. The Vikings took no mercy upon the poor Monks that inhabited
          this tiny island, many were drowned, slaughtered like cattle or used
          as slaves. Following the seige of Lindisfarne, many nearby villages in
          and isles were pillaged and plundered by the savage beasts from
          Scandenavia and within a few years after the first attack in AD 789,
          none of the British Isles were safe.

        <h3 class="h3">England's New Hope</h3>
        <p>
          By AD 866 the Vikings had plundered and ravaged their way through
          northern England, parts of Scotland and parts of Ireland, reigning
          terror wherever they went. The Danish Vikings had by now taken the
          city of York (Jorvik) and turned it into a kingdom of their own. The
          Kings of Northumbria at the time, Aelle and Osbert, managed to flee
          the cpatured city with their lives, the survival of Aelle goes on to
          play a key factor in the downfall of Ivar the Boneless.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the Vikings securing Jorvik, King Alfred came to power in AD
          871, he was the first English King to turn the tables on the Vikings,
          defeating them at the battle of Edington in AD 878. After this
          historic victory the Viking leader at the battle of Edingotn, Guthrum,
          converted to Christianity. Guthrum's conversion was a milestone in
          turning the tides of war on the Vikings.

        <p>
          AD 886, Aflred defeated the Vikings once again and successfully
          returned London to English rule, he fortified the city to prevent the
          Vikings from raiding the city in the ocming years. Alfred successfully
          signed a treaty with Guthrum in the smae year, the treaty saw to
          partition England between the Vikings and the English, seeing Viking
          territory as 'Danelaw'.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, in AD 937 led the Enlgish to a victory
          over the Vikings at the battle of Brunaburh an became the first
          English Kind to incoporate Danelaw into his kingdom. By AD 954 the
          last Viking leader of York, Eirik Bloodaxe, was defeated in battle and
          for the first time since AD 866, York was under Enlgish rule.

        <h3 class="h3">Return of the Vikings</h3>
        <p>
          Despite Athelstan's victory over Eirik Bloodaxe at York the Viking
          raids did not cease, different bands of Vikings continued to make
          regular voyages to the coast of England for decades after the battle
          of Brunaburh. In AD 991 Aethelred, the King of England at the time,
          Olaf Tryggvason's raiding party defeated the English defenders
          Aethelred was forced to pay off the raiders in an attempt to pay off a
          further invasion and plunge England into Danelaw once again.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Vikings were not defeated just yet, England would see four further
          Viking Kings between AD 1013 and AD 1042, the strongest of these kings
          was King Cnut. King Cnut was the king of Denmark and England during
          his reign, however, King Cnut was unlike any Danish King before him,
          he was a Christian. King Cnut did not force England to obey Danelaw
          and, in fact, recognised Anglo-Saxon law as well as Danelaw. He
          attempted to engineer a North Atlantic empire in which Scandanavia and
          Britain would be a united front. King Cnut, depsite his large
          aspirations, saw an early grave at the age of 39 and his succesor, his
          son, did not have the successful reign his Father before him had
          enjoyed.

        <h3 class="h3">The Last of the Vikings</h3> 
        <p>
        The last of the Viking invasions of England occured in AD 1066. Harald Hardrada, King of Norway at the time, 
        sailed up the River Humber and then marched his men to stamford Bridge, Harold Godwinson, King of England at the time, 
        marhed his army north to meet Harald Hardrada, Hardrada was defeated after a hard and bloody battle was fought. 
        England had repelled its last invasion from the Vikings that would ever occur.
        </p>
        <p>
        
        </p>
        Unfortunately for Harold Godwinson, William of Conquerer (who was of Viking decent but identified as French, previous generations
        of Vikings had landed on Normandy's shores over a century ago but over time had adopted the French way of life), invaded the South of England. Godwinson's army marched south to 
        meet the Norman invaders but tired and bruised from their battle against Harald Hardrada, Godwinson's army was no match for William.
        The battle was deemed the Battle of Hastings and the irony is that despite historuy writing that the Battle was a Norman victory, William, being 
        of Viking descent, technically provided the Vikings with one last victory over England, this would be the last time any Viking 
        was succesfull in invading England and saw the end of a centuries long power struggle.
