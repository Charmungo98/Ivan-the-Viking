          The Vikings first began their invasion of Britain in AD 793, a
          historic year between two "nations" that sparked the beginning of a
          200 year war between the Vikings and the Anglo Saxons. The centuries
          long war saw the loss of countless lives of men, women and children,
          some innocent and some... less so. The vast majority of the Vikings
          inital invasions were fueled purely by greed and their desire to
          plunder, however, as the decades progressed the invasions were spurred
          by an alterior motive, especially the invasions exercised by Ivar the
          Boneless. This article will dive into the history of the Vikings,
          particulary the most famous and arguably successful Viking of all,
          Ivar the Boneless, son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

          The Vikings initial attack saw the seige of a monestary at
          Lindisfarne. Lindisfarne is a small island off the Northeast coast of
          England. The Vikings took no mercy upon the poor Monks that inhabited
          this tiny island, many were drowned, slaughtered like cattle or used
          as slaves. Following the seige of Lindisfarne, many nearby villages in
          and isles were pillaged and plundered by the savage beasts from
          Scandenavia and within a few years after the first attack in AD 789,
          none of the British Isles were safe.

            By AD 866 the Vikings had plundered and ravaged their way through
            northern England, parts of Scotland and parts of Ireland, reigning
            terror wherever they went. The Danish Vikings had by now taken the
            city of York (Jorvik) and turned it into a kingdom of their own. The
            Kings of Northumbria at the time, Aelle and Osbert, managed to flee
            the cpatured city with their lives, the survival of Aelle goes on to
            play a key factor in the downfall of Ivar the Boneless.

          <p>
            Following the Vikings securing Jorvik, King Alfred came to power in
            AD 871, he was the first English King to turn the tables on the
            Vikings, defeating them at the battle of Edington in AD 878. After
            this historic victory the Viking leader at the battle of Edingotn,
            Guthrum, converted to Christianity. Guthrum's conversion was a
            milestone in turning the tides of war on the Vikings.

          <p>
            AD 886, Aflred defeated the Vikings once again and successfully
            returned London to English rule, he fortified the city to prevent
            the Vikings from raiding the city in the ocming years. Alfred
            successfully signed a treaty with Guthrum in the smae year, the
            treaty saw to partition England between the Vikings and the English,
            seeing Viking territory as 'Danelaw'.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alfred's grandson, Athelstan, in AD 937 led the Enlgish to a victory
            over the Vikings at the battle of Brunaburh an became the first
            English Kind to incoporate Danelaw into his kingdom. By AD 954 the
            last Viking leader of York, Eirik Bloodaxe, was defeated in battle
            and for the first time since AD 866, York was under Enlgish rule.
